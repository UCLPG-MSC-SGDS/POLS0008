Welcome to **POLS0008: Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods**. This is one of the first year core module for students enrolled on one of the degree programmes via the cross-faculty initiative [**[UCL Social Data Institute (SODA)]**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/social-data/home/social-data-institute). This is open to students on the following degree programmes: 

- **BSc Philosophy, Politics and Economics with Social Data Science**
- **BA Geography with Social Data Science**
- **BSc Population Health Science (Data Science)**
- **BSc Social Sciences with Data Science**

## Description {-} 

This module will introduce students to the key tenets of quantitative methods in the social sciences. It assumes no knowledge of quantitative methods or statistical software. Hence, it caters for students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and adopts a practical hands-on approach to learning, with tutor supported computer tutorials. The module covers descriptive statistics (central tendency and variation), data visualisation, data access, probability, sampling, hypothesis testing, inferential statistics and ends with an introduction to simple linear regression. Students will be introduced to the R statistical software and work with real-world data.

## Structure {-}

For the first four weeks, we will do a deep-dive covering all facets on **Descriptive Statistics** and **R-programming** - this will be taught by **Dr. Anwar Musah**. From Week 5 to 10, it will be focused on **Inferential Statistics** - this will be covered by **Dr. Stephen Jivraj**. Nearing the end of the course, you will be given an assignment i.e., a **3,000 word essay (counting 100% towards your final mark for this course)** based on secondary analysis of survey data. This information will be introduced to you accordingly by both the module tutors to help you to mentally prepare for this moment.

All lecture notes, recommended reading and seminar learning materials as well as **some** supplementary video content will be hosted on this webpage.

You can download the lecture notes and data sets for the practical and seminar lesson from the table below.
